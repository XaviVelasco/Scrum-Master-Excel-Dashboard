# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's Excel Dashboard

## :eye: Overview

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.

This Excel workbook offers a comprehensive overview of a Scrum team's performance, organized into three worksheets:

- Sprint_details
- Data 
- Pivot Tables
- Dashboard

## :abacus: Skills and formulas used

This Excel file demonstrates a variety of essential data analysis and visualization skills that are crucial for understanding the performance of a Scrum team. Below is a detailed breakdown of the skills and specific Excel functions utilized:

I've created cross-sheet references to ensure that the data is always consistent.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Manual Data Entry and Validation**: Ensuring that all sprint data is accurately entered and validated, eliminating errors that could affect calculations and visualizations.
- **Data Structuring**: Organizing data in a table format with clear headers and consistent data types, making it easier to analyze and create pivot tables.

### Pivot Tables

Dynamic Data Aggregation: Pivot tables are used to dynamically summarize and group data, allowing for flexible analysis of metrics such as planned issues, unplanned issues, and story points (SP) across different sprints.
Filtering and Slicing: Pivot tables enable quick filtering of data by sprint, issue type, or any other relevant category, which helps in identifying trends and making data-driven decisions.

### Sprint_details

This Excel sheet is used to manually enter new data observed in the sprints, which will then be used for the rest of the tables and the creation of the team's control dashboard.

Below you can find the description of the data (columns) used in this sheet:

| Column name | Column description |
|---|---|
| Sprint | Sprint Number | 
| Hours |Hours that the team is available to develop in this sprint |
| Planned Issues | Number of Issues or tasks that the team has planned to do in this sprint |
| Planned SP | Total of the Story Points the team has commited to do in this sprint |
| Planned Issues Done | Number of issues done that were planned |
| Unplanned Issues Done | Number of issues done that were NOT planned |
| Bugs (Issues) | Total Amount of bug issues done during this sprint (planned or unplanned) |
| Planned SP Done	| Number of Story Points Done that were planned |
| Unplanned SP Done | Number of Story Points Done that were NOT planned |
| Bugs (SP)	| SP of bugs done during this sprint (planned or unplanned) |

### Data Table

Contains raw data from Scrum sprints, including team availability (hours), story points or issues planned and completed, bugs resolved, and other calculations that provide insights into sprint performance and forecasting.
