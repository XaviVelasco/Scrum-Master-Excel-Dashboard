# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's Excel Dashboard

## :eye: Overview

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.

This Excel workbook offers a comprehensive overview of a Scrum team's performance, organized into three worksheets:

- Sprint_details
- Data 
- Pivot Tables
- Dashboard

## :abacus: Skills and formulas used

This project demonstrates a range of data analysis skills that are crucial for understanding the performance of a Scrum team, including data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization, as well as the application of various Excel formulas and tools. Below is a detailed breakdown of the skills and specific Excel functions utilized:

- **Data Management**:
     - Data Backup and Handling: Ensuring data integrity by maintaining backup sheets.
     - Manual Data Entry and Validation: Ensuring that all sprint data is accurately entered and validated, eliminating errors that could affect calculations and visualizations.
     - Data Cleaning: Preparing the raw data for analysis, removing inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy.
     - Data Structuring: Organizing data in a table format with clear headers and consistent data types, making it easier to analyze and create pivot tables. Cross-sheet references to ensure that the data is always consistent.
     - Conditional Formatting: To highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important data points visually.


- **Analytical Skills**:
     - PivotTables: Used to dynamically summarize data, allowing for quick analysis of key metrics across different sprints.
     - Filtering and Slicing: Pivot tables enable quick filtering of data by sprint, issue type, or any other relevant category, which helps in identifying trends and making data-driven decisions.

- **Visualization Skills**:

     - Dashboard Creation: Crafting a dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends, making complex data easily understandable.
     - Conditional Formatting: Used to highlight important data points, such as compliance rates and sprint performance, providing quick visual cues.

### Formulas and Functions

This Excel contains advanced use of Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, SUM, AVERAGE, ROUNDUP, and arithmetic operations to process and analyze the data.

Below you can find the description of the data (columns) used in this sheet:

| Column name | Column description |
|---|---|
| Sprint | Sprint Number | 
| Hours |Hours that the team is available to develop in this sprint |
| Planned Issues | Number of Issues or tasks that the team has planned to do in this sprint |

### Dashboard

The dashboard created in this Excel file is a powerful tool for Scrum Masters and Product Owners, providing several key insights. It is a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) tailored for the Scrum Master. The dashboard highlights team velocity, defect trends, and other critical metrics, as well as next sprint forecasting.

- **Sprint Performance Tracking**: By comparing planned versus completed tasks, the dashboard allows Scrum Masters to assess the team's ability to meet sprint goals. This is crucial for maintaining team productivity and identifying any obstacles early on.
- **Unplanned Work Monitoring**: The dashboard tracks the occurrence of unplanned tasks and their impact on the sprint. This helps in understanding scope creep and its effect on the team's ability to deliver on their commitments.
- **Bug Tracking**: By including bug fixes in the analysis, the dashboard helps in assessing the quality of the work delivered and the effectiveness of the team in addressing issues as they arise.
- **Compliance Rates**: The dashboard tracks compliance with sprint goals, providing a clear picture of the team's reliability and consistency over time. This metric is particularly useful for long-term planning and resource allocation.
- **Resource Utilization**: By analyzing the hours worked and story points delivered, the dashboard provides insights into how effectively the team's resources are being utilized. This can inform decisions about team capacity and workload management.
