# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's Excel Dashboard

Dashboard created in Excel for Scrum Masters.

## Overview

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.

## Key Skills

- Exploring Data with PivotTables: I can now leverage PivotTables to extract valuable insights from data, optimizing my workflow with keyboard shortcuts and mastering data slicing and custom grouping.
- Intermediate Logical Functions: Proficiency in logical functions such as Nested IFs, SWITCH, COUNTIFS, and SUMIFS allows me to identify ideal customer profiles, create targeted marketing strategies, and foster business growth.
- What-If Analysis: I've mastered scenario analysis using Excel's What-If Analysis tool, understanding the impact of variables, conducting sensitivity analysis, and making informed predictions for dynamic business environments.
- Forecasting: I can now forecast future trends effectively, using techniques like moving averages, trendline forecasts, and Forecast Sheets to communicate findings.
