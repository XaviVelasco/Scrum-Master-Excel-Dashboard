# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's Excel Dashboard

Dashboard created in Excel for Scrum Masters.

## Overview

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.
