# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's Excel Dashboard

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.

## Overview

This Excel workbook offers a comprehensive overview of a Scrum team's performance, organized into three worksheets:

- **Data Table**: Contains raw data from Scrum sprints, including team availability (hours), story points or issues planned and completed, bugs resolved, and other calculations that provide insights into sprint performance and forecasting.
- **Pivot Tables**: Dynamically generated pivot tables that enable flexible data exploration and analysis across various dimensions. These tables are also used to create the dashboard.
- **Dashboard**: A visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) tailored for the Scrum Master. The dashboard highlights team velocity, defect trends, and other critical metrics, as well as next sprint forecasting.
