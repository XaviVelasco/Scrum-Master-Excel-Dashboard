# ðŸ“Š Scrum Master's Excel Dashboard

## Overview

As a Scrum Master, I developed this dashboard to monitor and manage the performance of the development team. I have continuously adapted and added new features and visualizations as needed. Currently, I update the dashboard whenever I require new insights or need to analyze data for forecasting.

This Excel workbook offers a comprehensive overview of a Scrum team's performance, organized into three worksheets:

- Data Table
- Pivot Tables
- Dashboard

## Worksheet explanation

### Data Table

Contains raw data from Scrum sprints, including team availability (hours), story points or issues planned and completed, bugs resolved, and other calculations that provide insights into sprint performance and forecasting.

### Pivot Tables

- Pivot Tables: Dynamically generated pivot tables that enable flexible data exploration and analysis across various dimensions. These tables are also used to create the dashboard.

### Dashboard

- Dashboard: A visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) tailored for the Scrum Master. The dashboard highlights team velocity, defect trends, and other critical metrics, as well as next sprint forecasting.
